# About Me

## Introduction
Hi! I'm a **software developer** passionate about creating elegant solutions to complex problems. I specialize in web development, with a focus on building performant, user-friendly applications.

## Background
I discovered programming during college and have been hooked ever since. What started as a hobby building simple websites has evolved into a career creating full-stack applications and developer tools.

## What I Do
I work across the full stack, but I'm particularly passionate about:

- **Frontend Development**: Crafting intuitive user interfaces with modern frameworks
- **Backend Systems**: Building scalable APIs and services
- **Developer Tools**: Creating tools that make developers' lives easier
- **Open Source**: Contributing to and maintaining open source projects

## My Approach
I believe in:

- **Clean Code**: Writing code that's easy to read, maintain, and extend
- **User-Centric Design**: Putting users first in every decision
- **Continuous Learning**: Technology evolves fast; staying current is essential
- **Collaboration**: The best solutions come from teamwork and diverse perspectives
- **Pragmatism**: Using the right tool for the job, not just the newest one

## Experience Highlights
Throughout my career, I've:

- Built and deployed **20+ production applications** serving thousands of users
- Contributed to **15+ open source projects** with over 5,000 GitHub stars combined
- Mentored **10+ junior developers** through code reviews and pair programming
- Spoken at **5+ tech meetups** on web performance and modern JavaScript
- Written **technical articles** read by 50,000+ developers

## Technical Philosophy
I'm a strong advocate for:

- **Performance**: Fast software is better software
- **Accessibility**: Technology should be usable by everyone
- **Sustainability**: Writing maintainable code is an investment
- **Simplicity**: The best code is often the simplest solution

## Beyond Coding
When I'm not coding, you can find me:

- 📚 Reading technical books and blogs
- 🎮 Playing strategy games
- 🏃 Running and staying active
- ☕ Exploring coffee shops
- 🎨 Experimenting with design
- 🌱 Learning new technologies

## Currently Learning
I'm always expanding my skillset. Right now I'm diving deep into:

- **Rust**: For systems programming and performance
- **WebAssembly**: For bringing high-performance code to the web
- **Machine Learning**: Understanding AI/ML fundamentals
- **DevOps**: Container orchestration and CI/CD pipelines

## Values
What drives me as a developer:

1. **Quality over Quantity**: I'd rather build one thing well than ten things poorly
2. **Impact over Complexity**: Simple solutions that solve real problems
3. **Learning over Knowing**: Curiosity and growth mindset
4. **Sharing over Hoarding**: Knowledge multiplies when shared
5. **Progress over Perfection**: Ship and iterate

## Fun Facts
- I've written code in **15+ programming languages**
- My first program was a calculator in Visual Basic
- I have a collection of **100+ programming books**
- I contribute to open source almost every week
- I'm a mechanical keyboard enthusiast (currently using a custom 65%)

## Get in Touch
I'm always interested in:

- **Collaborating** on interesting projects
- **Discussing** technology and best practices
- **Helping** with code reviews or technical questions
- **Connecting** with other developers
- **Exploring** new opportunities
